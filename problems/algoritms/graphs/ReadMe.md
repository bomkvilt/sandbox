def. **Graph** — is a structure made from objects named as **vertices** and relations betwean the **vertices** named **edges**.

Graph's verices can contain any payload and it is not included to a common Graph classification since it not changes graph's topology. But Graph's edges' changes. According to edge structure there are two class of graphs:
- Weightless graphs — edges of the graph are explained with *origin* and *destination* vertices
- Weighted graphs — enges of the graphs are explained with *origin* and *destination* vertices and with an abstract value named *weigth*; usualy, *wight* is a real or an integer.
